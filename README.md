This project serves as a hands-on approach to refamiliarizing myself with React's core concepts, specifically focusing on the differences between class components and function components. The goal is to deepen my understanding of:

- **React Lifecycle Methods** (in class components)
- **React Hooks** (in function components)
- **Component rendering** and **re-rendering** behaviors in React

## Key Learning Objectives:

1. **Class Components:**
   - Understanding lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `shouldComponentUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.
   - How state and props are managed within class components.
   
2. **Function Components:**
   - Using hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` to manage state and side effects.
   - Exploring how function components simplify the structure of React apps without lifecycle methods, relying on hooks instead.

3. **React Rendering & Re-rendering:**
   - Investigating when React triggers a re-render based on state or prop changes.
   - The difference between initial renders, updates, and cleanup phases.
